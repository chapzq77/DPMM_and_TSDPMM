religion christian others homosexuality far detail issues give primarily conservative point view posting summarizes several issues homosexuality christians frequently asked question post question time attempt summarize postings discussion summarizes arguments allowing christian homosexuality since people asking question already know arguments common only question dealt christian justify being homosexual given bible says definition homosexual many groups believe homosexual orientation sexual attraction members sex distinguished homosexual sexual activity homosexuals sex considered groups acceptable however lot discussion term homosexual means someone actually homosexual sex generally accepted outside liberal groups paper going homosexual meaning person sexual acts another sex heard any biblical argument person homosexual orientation remains think people admit homosexual called homosexual orientation known evidence suggesting best evidence seen homosexuality single number different probably several groups try people move being homosexual best known exodus international reports seen read detailed just minority opinion presbyterian church report human sexuality suggest very low success rates questions real certainly people say however issue important sounds believe homosexuality wrong believe wrong defined god fact hard being homosexual relevant fact hard escape being drug wrong wrong may deal people very difficult change may tend willing forgive general issue common quote figure population homosexual asked came response see source figure defines sexuality orientation persons scale completely completely according third male adults experience post experiences held true study done institute based data early seventies published early believe put hand

problems sex means medical division foundation joint author martin eugene joint author sex moral conditions card figure used scholarly discussions hold true several noted child gay running talk shows book allegedly study scholarly world seems seen study detail include someone another view willing include christians believe homosexuality sex wrong however accept community churches best known formed specifically accept homosexuals however united church christ allows think couple groups may church seems accept areas others churches government congregations accept southern number probably only congregations churches homosexual church leaders carefully another issue any doubt homosexual pastors just every open others arguments biblical issues attempt summarize issues commonly cited reference homosexuality previous discussions john christianity social homosexuality chicago press argument pretty clear several explicit laws ot paul seems pretty negative homosexuality references passages cited subject probably relevant sin inhabitants sodom proposed carry homosexual rape homosexual activity adults question homosexual since involved angels particularly horrifying because involved responsibility towards culture very strong probably reason lot offered daughter better give daughter allow look concordance references sodom elsewhere bible see imply homosexuality sin jewish tradition major sin any rate debate homosexual rape wrong discuss because law part set laws christians consider binding lev alone settle issue references paul number references paul sins words fairly words mean homosexual says greek words appear cor tim unfortunately entirely clear words actually mean basic meaning variety meanings writing likely reports interpretation church including greek speaking christians passage referred meaning only cent practice come references late edition catholic male prostitute giving evidence church fathers understood term referring homosexuality general technical meaning suggested early latin translations active homosexual male prostitute view paul intend conservative view fee cor evidence meant effeminate however warns greek culture effeminate necessarily homosexual may associated kinds homosexual given fee say taken together term simply very applies homosexuals cases general term homosexuality fee ends suggesting translation seems essentially big problem word used paul writing fact word clearly composed male unfortunately quite tell meaning since tell male subject object action examples words formed way given theory refer dangerous base meaning purely religious expression because based god however since fee agree homosexual male prostitute seems good guess any note translation strong term however something fee agree attempt translation opinion reference homosexuality romans points speaks homosexuality something happened people naturally result due worshipping false gods argue simply example homosexual worshipped false gods fall perhaps become however argument somewhat forced fact homosexual readers seriously proposed paul meant however sufficient create law homosexuality christians paul describing homosexuality christians homosexuality part despite left rhetoric sure paul does believe completely sex given description situation assume sex believe passage indicates negative view homosexuality nature acts general spiritual state people specific homosexuality view situation following think evidence confident paul disapproved homosexuality seems clear cor tim general homosexuality wording come someone approved homosexuality considered acceptable cases hand passages explicit teachings subject really refers homosexuality result situation people interpret passages light general approach scripture look scripture laws issues surprising consider passages ot prohibition approach bible liberal surprising regard paul negative view homosexuality something took jewish upbringing any serious light gospel readers group know assumptions radically different people tend foam mouth see view described lot moderator situation number discussions past sort detailed texts described above however fact homosexuality actually base beliefs real issue seems rest question paul judgement apply modern homosexuality commonly claim paul simply faced kinds questions trying deal encountered homosexuality only people probably agree wrong faced experience christians try act straight fail faced christians trying define christian homosexuality general christian sexuality relationship god man unfair paul judgement homosexuality questions another following paul time homosexuality associated number things christians acceptable part temple private occured adults children people slaves position say always reasons think distinguished active partner considered act partner reason active homosexual prostitute considered people enjoyed role idea tend engaged clearly christian homosexuals sex children slaves others position fully responsible partners however fee cor examples ancient homosexual involve adults way considerations paragraph pushed far homosexuality may jews surely cases involve slaves children people argued aids judgement homosexuality point aids transmitted sex homosexual someone homosexual relationship christian criteria marriage aids note good reason paul general approach doubt homosexuality fully equal alternative apart any specific statements homosexuality believe genesis story lead regard marriage god however way paul deals questions provides warning being quick deal issue legally claim question homosexual christians entirely theological issue paul tendency see issues principle issues look very carefully good people involved avoid personally example paul clearly believed acceptable wanted avoid people doing action personal another example paul obviously see people circumstances remain unable certainly see married state fornication believe view accepting views paul expressed may believe homosexuality god intended occured result sin times live note creation story work human life result sin mean christians working saved question believe homosexuality sinful believe broad sense due human willing consider approach becomes judgement damage caused finding way live trying trying attempt does damage psychological damage broken marriages attempts living fail going depend nature homosexuality believe very serious wrong may willing run high serious damage clearly generally suggest people live tendency steal drug attempts conditions very difficult however conditions way obvious homosexuality many problems associated homosexuality actually problems promiscuity homosexuality includes aids only sort homosexual christian consider allowing christian course discussing heard lot personal fellow christians situation seen various research various efforts conversion presbyterian report mentioned above faq summarizes readers reports question evidence long term success changing orientation par healing danger christians depend change clear conversion happen always people left despair feeling excluded church nothing say life long paul recognized different context demand people think history strongly judgement result homosexuals gay sex rest side homosexuality maybe homosexuality god original imagine paul see people long term committed christian promiscuity work genesis part god original think vehicle people god love issue biblical interpretation underlying discussion issue cultural paul says something wrong taken eternal statement things wrong because specific situations culture time conservative christians generally taking since otherwise bible becomes everything relative looking issue worth completely rejects concept cultural number testament conservative christians consider relative following clear bible anything said homosexuality prohibition interest times ot mention because recently church consider binding christians prohibition slavery judgement sinner regard items binding cases believe argument essentially cultural briefly prohibition interest appropriate specific society bible trying build market economy people believe american judicial kind jesus concerned people believe paul simply telling people live slavery people believe morally roman point trying before biblical cent need look cent actions christian homosexuals say different greek homosexuality paul familiar exactly kind argument being judicial fairly recently christians taking interest many christians regarded slavery endorsed indeed slavery common relationship god human beings christians called servants slaves god trying say everything bible relative trying say things therefore say because something appears bible ends discussion need look action talking moral implications bible talking christians want argue reasons think homosexuality binding willing listen claim question need looked themselves part small minority really rules above thing great issue consider biblical evidence laws passage subject matter really homosexuality couple words ambiguous amount concern raising christians seems proportion suggest people reasons simply biblical involved true sides clearly homosexual christians strongly motivated ways biblical arguments conservative christians biblical arguments feeling bible being used sides way come sources dangerous situation christians side issue note problems pro homosexual position commonly presented common arguments homosexuality determined god homosexual choice think god homosexual fine view people already believe grounds homosexuality acceptable see argument many people think largely drug may turn mean ok particular things tend wrong people angry easily others tend arrogant others tend women married someone else homosexuality view wrong different any things going follow god time another having work bad particular temptations cause problems sit back say because god way just jesus said cross daily concept dying self appears paul seems suggest going things ourselves called accept paul experience christians history show sin battle difficult fact homosexuality difficult fight
